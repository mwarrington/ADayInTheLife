Version 2.4
- Removed "Custom shaders" tab; now the tool calculates automagically the shader info of your custom shaders!, no more manual setup for custom shaders!.
- When "Create prefabs" is selected on the advanced tab, a small message in
the Objects GUI reminds the user the bake process will be slow.
- Small modifications for performance and support of Standard shader for Unity 5. (Still standard shader is not supported)
- "Not Optimizable" shaders now show in red, and the rest of recognized shaders are in black.
- Updated README.txt
- small bugs fix
Version 2.3
- Added OptimizableShader.cs. now workflow is more organized and per shader.
- Removed internal code on GUI and moved it to OptimizableShader->OptimizeShader().
- Refactored code to be easier to support Unity 5's data-driven standard shader!. (Still standard shader is not supported)
- Added "Search Status" instead of "Status:" in the console log for the advanced GUI.
Version 2.2
- Changed BuildTarget.iOS to BuildTarget.iPhone as it changed in Unity 4.5.5 in the atlasser
Version 2.1
- Atlas is now transparent by default preventing render errors on the edges for transparent materials when the atlas isnt fully used. Fix by Mike from M2H studios
- Solved bug where multiple materials objects where parented and scaled where not correctly re-scaled and re-parented on the optimized object.
Version 2.0.1
- Added LOD Automatic script link in README.txt from Mike from M2H studios
Version 2.0
- UI Revamp.
- Added new "Advanced" tab that contains Advanced search and Advanced options.
- Selection can now be filtered by tags or by layers
- Removed Reuse textures, Remove atlassed before bake and Generate prefabs options from Objects and placed it into the Advanced UI.
- Added a console status on the advanced UI that shows the last action done when doing an advanced search.
- Small performance improvements when drawing the UI and more cleaner code base.
- Added descriptions for the advanced options.
- Updated Examples with new baked scenes.
Version 1.9.5
- Small performance improvements
- cleanup some code on the GUI side
- separated different GUIs from the main menu class.
Version 1.9.4
- Performance improvements when processing for platforms like iPhone Android.
- Multiple materials objects texture formats are now supported
- Be able to combine 1 GameObject with multiple materials
Version 1.9.31
- invalid characters in generated prefabs are now corrected and saved to a valid folder name
Version 1.9.3
- Added known issues section on README.txt
- added log error saying that multiple materials and a non compatible texture format is not supported yet.
Version 1.9.2
- Solved crash when object has more than 1 material, has different shaders and the shaders are not recognized
Version 1.9.1
- Solved crash problem when an object with more than 1 material had different shaders.
Version 1.9
- Tool now automagically supports any texture format. (it internally converts the texture to RGBA32, process it and then reimports back the texture to its original state)
- Normal textures are automatically marked as normal maps, if the tool cant figure out it will display a warning message.
- Atlasses automatically get set their closest import texture size i.e atlas size is: 3072, it gets set to 4096.
Version 1.8
- Added checkbox for generating prefabs for baked objects. (Unchecked by default), With this checked it takes _more_ time as it generates the meshes and prefabs for the objects.
--> For each gameobject a prefab gets generated regardless if its repeated or not.
- Changed token for optimized objects from =>ODCObj to .ODCObj so prefab generation gets done correctly when saving prefabs to the project.
- Re built all the examples with the new token (.ODCObj)
- Organized README to show better the tutorial and the contact info.
Version 1.7
- Organized link in README for intro video, now it points correctly.
- Packed Examples folder into a .unityPackage file in order to avoid loading times on the tool, now you just can double click the .unitypackage and it will import the examples
- Atlasses bigger than 4096x4096 now displays a warning that resize will be done by Unity when using it.
Version 1.63
- Fixed small bug that made the app crash when baking atlas on a non saved scene.
Version 1.62
- Fixed compile directives to avoid conflicts when building projects
version 1.61
- Added namespaces in order to avoid conflicts with repeated classes
Version 1.6
- Added support for Tiled Materials
Version 1.51
- Changed package name from ProDrawCall to Pro Draw Call.
Version 1.5
- Added support for multiple materials on game objects.
- Fixed reversed indexor that was conflicting with combining materials.
Version 1.0
